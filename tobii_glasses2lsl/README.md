# LSL Connector for Glasses 3
This is a complete sample that will expose Glasses3 data streams as Lab Streaming Layer data streams. To run the sample, just start it. It will automatically locate any available Glasses 3 device and register a stream outlet for the gaze stream from the unit. You can also download precompiled binaries (for windows) from the [releases section](https://github.com/tobiipro/Tobii.Glasses3.SDK/releases).

Check weather [TobiiSDK](https://github.com/tobiipro/Tobii.Glasses3.SDK) is needed.
