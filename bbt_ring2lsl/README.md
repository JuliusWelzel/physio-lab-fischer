# BBT ring to LSL
The python script sucessfully gets data from the ring and automatically creates LSL outlet and sends data for 3 seconds.

## To-dos:
- [] automate channel detection
- [] understand device.get_data() structure (so far 10 samples for 6 channels?)
- [] create automated channel info for LSL
